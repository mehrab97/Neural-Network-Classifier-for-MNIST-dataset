# Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network Classifier for MNIST-dataset
MNIST data is a combination of a lot of images. These have digits in them from 0 to 9. Every image has 1 digit
from 0 to 9. Our task is to build a neural network and a convolution neural network classifier which are going to predict which digit
the given image is going to contain.
